# CiviVolunteer

## Overview

The CiviVolunteer extension provides tools for signing up, managing, and tracking volunteers.

### Features

* Define multiple [volunteer projects](/projects).
    * (Optionally) [associate a project with a CiviCRM event](/projects#events).
    * Define specific [volunteer opportunities](/opportunities) for each project with distinct roles and shifts.
* Allow volunteers to:
    * [sign up for specific opportunities](/sign-up-form) themselves.
    * [express interest](/interest-form) generally in volunteering, without signing up for anything specifically.
* Manually [assign volunteers to shifts](/assignments)
* [Log](/logging-hours) and [report](/reporting) on volunteer hours

This documentation book provides assistance to users, administrators, and developers of CiviVoluneer.

* [Q&A on StackExchange](http://civicrm.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/civivolunteer) (with the `civivolunteer` tag)

## Requirements

* CiviCRM 4.4 or higher
* The [Angular Profiles](https://civicrm.org/extensions/angular-profile-utilities) extension must also be installed and enabled

## Known Issues

* The installer will not create the "register to volunteer" permission automatically for Joomla installations.

## Future plans

* Going forward there are some great ideas on the drawing board for phase 2 including: specification of qualifications and skill-matching, linking volunteer opportunities directly to an organization or individual, recurring volunteer opportunities, public recognition / rewards, and self-service logging of volunteer hours.
* If your organization has an invested interest in a CiviCRM installation, and you foresee a need for CiviVolunteer, consider donating to the ongoing development of CiviVolunteer through the [Make it Happen program](https://civicrm.org/make-it-happen/civivolunteer-improvements).
* Developers within organizations that would like to use CiviVolunteer are more than welcome to participate in the development and testing effort.
